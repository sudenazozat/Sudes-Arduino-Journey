LED Control and Signal Modulation with Arduino

Project Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of digital output control and current regulation using an Arduino microcontroller. The primary objective is to implement a stable pulse-width modulation to drive an optoelectronic component (LED). This study serves as an initial step into bio-instrumentation and hardware-biological system integration.
